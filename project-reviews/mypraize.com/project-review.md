# MyPraize

* Looking back at any projects, we always look back and call ourselves n00bs.
* Lessons from MyPraize
	* Domain Driven Design for the win
		* Figure it out
	* JavaScript Models
	* Have clear, simple, and effective front-to-back channels
	* Spring & Java must die! Too bloatedâ€¦ too abstract
	* Don't Cheat with angular
	* Spend more time on your ORM, it may actually be better to write your own, at least have a lower-level one.
	* Winners:
		* AngularJS
		* Sockets
		* Beanstalk
		* Data Migrations
		* LESS /  SAAS
		* Deployment Scripts
	* All data-driven applications ought use these frameworks
		* Hint hint! (CMS)
	* Time to re-write MyPraize!
