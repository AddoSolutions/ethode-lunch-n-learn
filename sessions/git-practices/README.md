## What is Git Flow

Git Flow is fundamentally a set of best practices and standardization of git repositories.

This is the skinny:

* All code changes are made in a branch. That branch is prefixed by what kind of change it is (feature, hotfix, etc.)
* Your development enviornment is to reflect the code in the `develop` branch, and production is to reflect `master`
* Versions are to be marked using tags

Based on this, a command line tool has been made to assist in performing these tasks effectively.
