# Git Flow Talk

As requested by the team here: https://trello.com/c/kzz2YqTv/230-git-best-practices-including-gitflow

## Introduction

* Talking about Git… kind-of
* Created Repo for these talks: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/AddoSolutions/ethode-lunch-n-learn)
* Talk about Git
* How it applies to Agile
* How to not write software (aka MyPraize)

## Git

* Go through GitHub Notes
* But let's get really practical
	* Most of us don't have enough devs/project to justify the overhead
	* Maybe except FTF
	* But everyone has to be willing use it
	* Big deterrent is how we look at projects
* Let's look how agile can solve more problems

## Agile

* What is it?
* We don't use it (I know I dont)
* (Trello Image) This is not agile
* (Show Stick-Note) This is Agile
* Agile is: Sticky Note Tree
* Why?
	* We all know it's cheaper
	* We all know everyone makes money
	* We all know it set's better expectations
	* More importantly?
	* Let's talk about developers
	* What characterizes developers?
		* Look at video games…
		* Lazy
		* Desire to Complete & Accomplish
	* How does agile really apply to people, not pocketbooks?
		* Success is truly Complete & Accomplish of a sprint
		* Weekly success
		* Prevents over-architecture while still allowing for some
			* Think end of Samos
		* Keeps moving
* How does this apply to Git?
	* When you waterfall everything is enormous & confusing
	* We desire Complete & Accomplish so we switch tasks with bumps
	* Huge scope, lots of confusion
	* Difficult to discuss
	* Stress is much higher
* So let's look at a great terrible example:

## MyPraize

* Looking back at any projects, we always look back and call ourselves n00bs.
* Lessons from MyPraize
	* Domain Driven Design for the win
		* Figure it out
	* JavaScript Models
	* Have clear, simple, and effective front-to-back channels
	* Spring & Java must die! Too bloated… too abstract
	* Don't Cheat with angular
	* Spend more time on your ORM, it may actually be better to write your own, at least have a lower-level one.
	* Winners:
		* AngularJS
		* Sockets
		* Beanstalk
		* Data Migrations
		* LESS /  SAAS
		* Deployment Scripts
	* All data-driven applications ought use these frameworks
		* Hint hint! (CMS)
	* Time to re-write MyPraize!
